WHY NODE JS? it is asynchronous
Here is how Node.js handles a file request:

Sends the task to the computer's file system.
Ready to handle the next request.
When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client.
Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.

WHERE AS PHP (it is synchronous)
{
    1-Sends the task to the computer's file system.
    2-Waits for the file system to opened and read the file,
    3- the server returns the content to the client.
    4-ready to handle next req
