WHAT IS NPM
NPM ->Node Packaging manager for javascript's runtime nodejs
NPM consists of two main parts:

(i) a CLI (command-line interface) tool for publishing and downloading packages, and
(ii) an online repository that hosts JavaScript packages



HOW TO INTIALISE IT?
use npm init(is se wo package.json() wali file json file bnti hai,isi me sbhi installation(jo npm se
lenge) dikhege ab)

node_modules :-- stores codes for our dependencies(modules ke code)

package.json me un dependencies(modules) ka khata(name ) rehta hai

WHY USE .mjs instead of .js ?


It indicates an ES6 module file.(.mjs )

Node.js's original module system is CommonJs (which uses require and module.exports).

Since Node.js was created, the ECMAScript module system (which uses import and export) has become standard and Node.js has added support for it.

Node.js will treat .cjs files as CommonJS modules and .mjs files as ECMAScript modules.
 It will treat .js files as whatever the default module system for the project is (which is CommonJS unless package.json says "type": "module",).
