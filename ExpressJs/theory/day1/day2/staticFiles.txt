To serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files, 
use the express.static built-in middleware function in Express
express.static(root, [options])
The root argument specifies the root directory from which to serve static assets.

For example, use the following code to serve images, CSS files, and JavaScript files in a
 directory named public:

app.use(express.static('public'))
