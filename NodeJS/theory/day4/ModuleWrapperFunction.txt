MODULE WRAPPER FUNCTION
 NodeJS does not run our code directly, it wraps the entire code inside a function before execution.
 This function is termed as Module Wrapper Function. 
Use of Module Wrapper Function in NodeJS:

The top-level variables declared with var, const, or let are scoped to the module rather than to the global object.
It provides some global-looking variables that are specific to the module, such as:
The module and exports object that can be used to export values from the module.
The variables like  __filename and __dirname, that tells us the moduleâ€™s absolute filename and its directory path.

//BEHIND THE SCENE
exports,require,module,__filename, __dirname ka scope is not global hence can be used in evry nodejs file
(function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
  //module code
});
